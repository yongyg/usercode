testSelection.C  --> analyze data to get the Alca trigger (or signal) efficiency per L1
addtestSelection.C  --> merge those output from different jobs
print_addtestSelection.C  --> print the efficiency results

for Alca Rate estimate , change the file testSelection.C so that only one run is used , and check the rate, need to know the average ilum of that run to scale to the projected ilum. 

print_L1rate.C --> print the rate results
